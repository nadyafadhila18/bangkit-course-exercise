# Machine-Learning

In this project, we make a model to detection an images to know what animal is shown by user. this model contain a transfer learning model named Xception that we use to improving our accuracy by using a fine tuning method.

We train or model with 50 Epoch and 5 Epoch for the Fine Tuning

We got the result :

  <img align="center" width="400" src="/Result/graph1.png" />
  <br/>
  <img align="center" width="400" src="/Result/resullt1.png" />
