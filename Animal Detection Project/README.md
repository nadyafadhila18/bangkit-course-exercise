# Sa Lindungi: Endangered Animal Image Detection

In this project, we make a model to detection an images to know what Endangered animal is shown by user. This datasets captired originally from me at Batu Secret Zoo. This model contain a transfer learning model named Xception that we use to improving our accuracy by using a fine tuning method.

We train or model with 50 Epoch and 5 Epoch for the Fine Tuning

We got the result :
